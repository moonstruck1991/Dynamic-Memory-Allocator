## Dynamic Memory Allocator

This is a Dynamic memory allocator which implements memory allocation using DLL, BS Tree and AVL Tree.





## Using Driver.java

```java Driver ```

followed by the input cases



## Using run.sh
```run.sh {input_file} {output_file}```

Example:
```run.sh test.in res.out```

Both arguments are optional, inputfile is the file containing the test cases and output file is where you want the result to be written into.
In the case any argument is missing, console is used for input or output.

A res_gold.out has been added which can be used to compare your results against the standard results.
